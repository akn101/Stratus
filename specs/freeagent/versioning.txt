          <h1>Versioning</h1>
<p>The FreeAgent API will soon use versioning so that non-backwards compatible changes can be deployed faster and with less risk.</p>

<p>Examples of a non-backwards compatible change could be:</p>

<ul>
<li>deleting an attribute</li>
<li>modifying the name of an attribute</li>
<li>changing the meaning of the response</li>
</ul>

<p>Changes which we would consider to be backwards compatible would not generate a new version. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>adding a new endpoint</li>
<li>adding an attribute to an existing endpoint</li>
<li>fixing a bug with the existing response</li>
</ul>

<p>All endpoints will accept a version from the <code>X-Api-Version</code> header in date format (e.g. <code>2024-10-01</code>).</p>

<p>You should set the date in the <code>X-Api-Version</code> header in your request to be on or after the version of the API endpoint you wish to access.</p>

<p>If there is a version available for that date, then you&#39;ll get the new behaviour. If there isn&#39;t then it&#39;ll fall back to the previous version.</p>

<p>If no version header is passed to the API, then you&#39;ll get back the version as it stands today, before versioning is introduced. This should mean that integrations not supplying version numbers will still work as normal.</p>

<p>If there are multiple versions available for an endpoint, you will see them listed on the documentation for that endpoint.  </p>

<p>An example API call with the header specified would look like this:</p>
<pre class=prettyprint><code class=>curl https://api.freeagent.com/v2/company \
  -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer TOKEN&quot; \
  -H &quot;Accept: application/json&quot; \
  -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
  -H &quot;X-Api-Version: 2024-10-01&quot; \
  -X GET
</code></pre>
<p>See the <a href="using_curl.html">Using the FreeAgent API with curl</a> page for more information on this format.</p>
